        What This Tool Does
This app is designed to help you figure out which EOTSS teams you should be working with to get your project done. It reads your project plan and suggests which EOTSS teams you should collaborate with. 

In the future, it could compare project plans against documented information about what different EOTSS departments do: things like business plans, capital plans, and enterprise standards. The goal is to give you a clearer sense of who‚Äôs already working in your space, who owns what, and where there might be overlap or collaboration opportunities.

You‚Äôll also see suggestions for projects that are similar or complementary to yours, helping you avoid duplication and spot potential partnerships.

This is an early prototype. It's not connected to the secure EOTSS environment, so it doesn‚Äôt use any internal data. That means:

Don‚Äôt upload sensitive project plans

The analysis is based only on public info from mass.gov, not internal documents like architecture review board materials

Still, it can give surprisingly helpful advice‚Äîand once it's connected to richer, internal sources, it should get even smarter. Each run takes about 4 minutes and costs around 17 cents.

    Please evaluate this plan against the organizational components above:
    1. Identify inter-team dependencies across EOTSS groups that might be needed to contribute to the work or validate compliance with IT Governance requirements. 
       Be specific here, citing which parts of the project plan might need to involve which other EOTSS offices or comply with which Governance Requirements. 
       If the project plan lists a schedule or milestones, specificy when in the timeline each stakeholder should be looped in. 
       You do not need to stretch to anticipate dependencies for every EOTSS Office: only cite likely dependencies. 
       Don't assume that users have access to the Governance Reference Table - when citing information from the table, cite the information rather than the location in the table. Do not reference the table at all. For example, do not mention IT Governance Reference Table Component 14
       At the end of each text block describing a team the project is dependent on, include a line saying "The best way to engage [this team] is to _____". Leave the blank spot to illustrate that such contact info is important to document. 
       If the project plan cites one of these stakeholder groups as the leader for the project, then do not make suggestions about when that group should get involved with the project.
       If the project plan included a timeline with milestones or steps, then after all blocks of text describing dependencies, include a summary table listing each milestone, stage, step, or phase of the project, and the team dependencies relevant to each stage. Only do this if such a timeline was included in the original plan and list those steps/phases/milestones/stages exactly as written in the original plan. 
    2. Check for misalignment with the Accessibility Policy. Be specific about which aspects of the project plan are likely to be most subject to Accessibility policies. 
    
    Use headings to visually seperate out these two components in your output. Add a third heading called Related Projects and underneath that heading say Coming Soon

        # Climate Data Lake Project

## Overview and Goals

This project will create a Commonwealth Climate Data Lake in partnership with multiple agencies across the state.

The Climate Data Lake seeks to:

- Enable secure, centralized access to climate-relevant datasets from across the Commonwealth.
- Support data exploration, transformation, integration, and visualization by staff, researchers, and the public.
- Ensure appropriate public access through a mass.gov front-end while protecting privacy through data risk reviews.

This project will entail designing and building the infrastructure to host climate data, establishing classification and metadata standards, enabling governance workflows, and launching a public-facing site.

## Outcomes

The project is complete when the following deliverables have been accepted by EOTSS and participating agencies:

- The centralized Climate Data Lake is operational in the Commonwealth‚Äôs cloud environment.
- Datasets from at least three agencies have been ingested, classified, and documented.
- A public-facing mass.gov data portal is live, providing access to approved climate data.
- Privacy risk assessments are conducted for all public-facing datasets.
- Governance and access workflows are in place for internal staff and external researchers.

## Approach

The Project Manager will provide weekly status updates to key stakeholders via email.

Work will be organized into biweekly sprints, following Agile delivery practices.

Deliverables will be demoed in recurring check-ins. Feedback will be incorporated within the same sprint or used to inform the next sprint.

Close collaboration will be maintained with data owners at participating agencies to ensure proper classification, quality review, and onboarding of datasets.
